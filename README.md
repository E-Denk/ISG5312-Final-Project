This is my final project for ISG5312. 

I am reanalyzing single-cell RNASeq from Single-nucleus transcriptional and chromatin accessibility analyses of maturing mouse Achilles tendon uncover the molecular landscape of tendon stem/progenitor cells.

Project structure:

-data

-README.md

-scripts

  -logs

data is where the fastq files will be downloaded to
scripts is where I will store the scripts to run Cell Ranger
logs is for .err and .out

A count_out directory will be made as the output folder for Cell Ranger count.
